# Eshop
This is a model of e-commerce website that's used to introduce a new feature called " lucky try "
This feature is meant to ensure the customer satisfaction for the website by its interesting nature
The execution of this project's working on the browser with the help of a server (i have used v.s.code live server) should be initialised with the session.html page
As this project is a front-end based, it is indifferent to the backend( i haven't used any database ) and instead of database, i have used some properties of the browser to store data (localStorage, sessionStorage)
